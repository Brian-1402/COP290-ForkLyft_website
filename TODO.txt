TODO

In forklyft.py:

-accessing links like /user etc without a login gives a internal server error. Should redirect to login page
-no food desc field in add item
-no remove item option in restaurant menu

To add browser js form filling:
    -fill complete information in restaurant add item
    -in profile page "password cannot be updated". also copy most of the checking from signup page too.

-no flash html code in restaurant pending orders, add items page


Bugs:
userhome assumes there are atleast 8 restaurants registered already
restaurant menu with no starters just shows blank area underneath starters heading


General:
-Confirmation on seperating frontend backend. 
-Check baadalvm proxy by looking at baadalvm website FAQ too.
-ML API
-Add commments everywhere to make code cleaner.
