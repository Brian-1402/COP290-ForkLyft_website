TODO

In forklyft.py:


-no food desc field in add item
-fix menu image sizing

To add browser js form filling:
    -fill complete information in restaurant add item
    -in profile page "password cannot be updated". also copy most of the checking from signup page too.

-no flash html code in restaurant pending orders, add items page


Bugs:
userhome assumes there are atleast 8 restaurants registered already
restaurant menu with no starters just shows blank area underneath starters heading


General:
-ML API
-Add commments everywhere to make code cleaner.
-update yaml API

Less important:
-add coverage to PATH in baadalvm to run tests there
